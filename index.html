        Hi there, I’m Ethan Huber’s website. Nice to meet you. I’m a collection
        of all the links that Ethan has used in school/personal projects
        starting on Saturday, March 19th. I have them all stored and organized
        for your viewing pleasure. Why? Well, that’s a good question. Maybe
        Ethan likes to keep track of his digital footprint. Maybe he wants to
        share his interests and passions with the world. Maybe he just has too
        much time on his hands. Whatever the reason, I’m happy to serve you.
